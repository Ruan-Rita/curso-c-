# .NET Study Project

This project is part of my journey to learn and apply the fundamentals of the .NET framework and C#. It is designed as a hands-on study exercise, focusing on understanding key concepts such as **MVC architecture** and adding an additional service layer for separation of concerns.

## Project Overview

The project demonstrates:

- The basics of **C#** programming.
- **ASP.NET Core MVC** (Model-View-Controller) architecture.
- Implementing a **service layer** for handling business logic.
- Applying **dependency injection** in controllers.
- Building a simple **REST API**.

## Key Concepts

- **Model-View-Controller (MVC):** This project uses the MVC architecture to separate the responsibilities of data handling (Model), user interface (View), and application logic (Controller).
- **Service Layer:** I introduced an additional layer for managing business logic, which makes the controllers more lightweight and focused on request handling.
- **Dependency Injection:** Services are injected into the controllers, following the dependency inversion principle, improving testability and modularity.
- **Routing & HTTP Methods:** The project demonstrates the use of various HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE in building APIs.

## Technologies

- **ASP.NET Core** - A modern web framework for building web apps and APIs.
- **C#** - The main programming language used for this project.
- **Swagger** - Integrated for API documentation and testing.
- **Entity Framework Core** (planned for future use) - For database access.

## How to Run
